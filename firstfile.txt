This file was created directly on GitHub via the web interface.

It is a simple text file, nothing more, nothing less.

Adding this line from Eclipse.

After I added ".project" and ".gitignore" to .gitignore (divide by zero anyone?), this change should force another commit...hopefully without the .project files...
...
and email address fixins

another change.

I am adding this line and committing it to my local repo in the master branch.  I want to see how conflicts work out in Egit.

This change should conflict with one on the local repo...what happens then?
